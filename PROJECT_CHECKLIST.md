# Central Hub Project Roadmap & Checklist

## 1. Documentation & Onboarding

- [x] Expand your README.md

  - [x] Add clear setup instructions (install, configure, run).
  - [x] Document all features, endpoints, and configuration options.
  - [x] Add a “How to update” section for users to pull new releases.
  - [x] Example: [Node.js README Example](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/Readme.md)

- [x] Add usage examples
  - [x] Show how to use each feature (file upload, streaming, etc.).
  - [x] Add curl or HTTPie examples for each endpoint.

## 2. Routing Improvements

- [x] Route Parameters

  - [x] Start using route params in your routes, e.g. `/files/:filename` for file operations.
  - Resource: [Express Route Params](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters)

- [x] RESTful Consistency

  - [x] Use plural nouns for collections (`/files`) and singular with params for single resources (`/files/:filename`).
  - [x] Refactor routes and controllers to match this pattern.

- [x] Route Grouping/Modular Routers
  - [x] Organize routes by feature (already good, but keep this as you add more services).

## 3. Middleware Enhancements

- [x] Middleware Chaining

  - [x] Add example middleware for logging, authentication, or request validation.
  - Resource: [Express Middleware Guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

- [ ] Per-route Middleware
  - [ ] Allow passing middleware to specific routes (see how Express allows arrays of handlers).
  - Resource: [Express Route Middleware Example](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-handlers)

## 4. Error Handling & Responses

- [x] 404 and 405 Responses

  - [x] Ensure all custom handlers return proper status codes and messages.

- [x] Consistent Error Format
  - [x] Standardize error responses (e.g., always return JSON with `{ error: "message" }` for API endpoints).

## 5. Feature Modularity & Configurability

- [x] Configurable Features

  - [x] Allow users to enable/disable features via config or .env (e.g., enable AI endpoints, disable metrics).

- [x] Safe Defaults
  - [x] Ensure server binds to localhost by default.
  - [x] No default credentials or open admin endpoints.

## 6. Testing & Quality

- [x] Expand Test Coverage

  - [x] Add tests for new routes, route params, and middleware.
  - [x] Ensure all core features have tests.

- [x] Cross-Platform Checks
  - [x] Use `path.join` everywhere for file paths.
  - [x] Avoid OS-specific shell scripts in onboarding/setup.

## 7. Release & Update Process

- [ ] Semantic Versioning

  - [ ] Use semver for releases (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.1.0).

- [ ] Changelog

  - [ ] Add a CHANGELOG.md to document new features, bugfixes, and breaking changes.

- [ ] Update Instructions
  - [ ] Document how users can safely update (e.g., `git pull`, review changelog, update .env if needed).

## 8. Learning Resources

- [Express Routing Guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
- [Express Middleware Guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
- [Node.js Routing Basics](https://nodejs.dev/learn/routing-in-nodejs)
- [RESTful API Design](https://restfulapi.net/)
- [How to Write a Good README](https://www.makeareadme.com/)
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

## 9. Optional: Advanced Features

- [x] Route Patterns & Wildcards

  - [x] Support for `/api/*` or `/files/:filename*` if needed.

- [ ] Modular Service Loading
  - [x] Dynamically load/enable modules based on config.
